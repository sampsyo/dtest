- intro: statistical quality properties are useful and we want to test them
- related work
    - auto-tuning (PetaBricks) and run-time algorithm selection (Nitro)
    - input distributions matter
    - distribution testing
- system overview
- distribution tests
- applications / case studies: introduce the application; the quality metric; the distribution test (from the previous section) that we will use
    - hashing (performance)
    - load balancing binary vector distance comparison (parallelism)
    - image filter (approximation)
    - learning (accuracy)
- implementation / usability / programmability case study
    - how the user applies the system to their application
    - how the tool works at run time
        - what it looks like (a) when it succeeds, and (b) when it fails
    - why the property you want is actually enforced
- results
    - dtest-ified systems outperform the best single configuration
